<h2>Banana Quest</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I've never played a point-and-click adventure game, so I can't say for sure.
I would like to think that my story/setting is original for an adventure game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It plays with only the mouse, no keyboard required.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to move a sprite using mouse and have a map larger than window size.
I experimented a lot in attempt to have the player click once and have the character move to the location of the mouse,
but it always bugged out.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Monkey (recolored): <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game">Phaser dude</a></li>
<li>Music: <a href="https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/donkey-kong-country-returns/01%2520-%2520Donkey%2520Kong%2520Returns.mp3">Donkey Kong Returns OST</a></li>
<li>Sound effect: <a href="http://www.orangefreesounds.com/mario-coin-sound/">Mario Coin</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Similar to the phaser tutorial, but is more like a top-down view than a platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A short game that is meant to be easy and relaxing to play. Play as a monkey on a quest to find all of the bananas scattered around the map.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme is a point-and-click adventure game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This is an adventure point-and-click game that varies each time in the location of the bananas. All banana locations are randomly generated.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
this game focuses on movement with mouse controls with moving camera
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A relaxing gaming experience, with nice music and sounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
As this is a point-and-click adventure game, the controls are simply to click at a spot and the sprite will head in that direction.
For optimal movement, hold the mouse button and to have the sprite follow.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Not really any strategy to the game as bananas are randomly generated.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a monkey that has not eaten in 2 days. Luckily, there are plenty of bananas scattered throughout the forest. Go on a quest to find the bananas!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
casual, for-fun players.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than a minute
</li>

</ul>
